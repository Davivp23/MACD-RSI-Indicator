# MACD+RSI-Indicator

A single TradingView indicator that combines both the **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and the **RSI** (Relative Strength Index).

## Why?

The free TradingView (Basic) plan allows a maximum of **3 indicators** on a single chart. Normally, using RSI and MACD would take up two of those three valuable slots.

This script combines them into **one single indicator**, freeing up a slot. This allows you to add other technical indicators (like Moving Averages, Volume, or Bollinger Bands) and maximize the potential of the free plan.
